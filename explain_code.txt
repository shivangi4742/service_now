Complexity of this code -

The time complexity of this code is O(n*k^2), where n is the number of sentences in the input file and k is the maximum number of words
 in a sentence pattern. This is because the code loops over each group of sentences and then loops over each sentence pattern within that group 
to find groups of similar sentences. The use of dictionaries (i.e., defaultdict) for grouping the sentences and sentence patterns allows for efficient 
lookup and insertion operations, which makes the code faster than a naive approach. However, the code still has to compare each sentence pattern to every 
other sentence pattern in the group, which can be time-consuming for large inputs.

The space complexity of the code is also O(n*k), since the code uses dictionaries to store the sentences and sentence patterns, and these dictionaries
can grow to contain all the sentences and patterns in the input file. The space required for the output file is also proportional to the size of the input
file, since the output file contains one line for each input line. Overall, the space complexity of the code is reasonable for most inputs,
but it may become a concern for very large inputs.

Optimization: The current implementation has a time complexity of O(n*k^2), which could be slow for very large input files. I would explore more efficient algorithms that can scale to very large datasets. For example, we might consider using indexing or hashing techniques to identify similar sentences more quickly.
Error handling: The current implementation assumes that the input file is well-formed, i.e., that each line contains a valid sentence with the correct format. In a real-world scenario, we would need to handle cases where the input file is malformed or contains unexpected data. I would add more robust error handling and logging to make the code more reliable.
Test coverage: While the current implementation includes some basic unit tests, I would aim to increase the test coverage to ensure that the code works correctly for a wide range of inputs. I would also consider adding integration tests to verify that the code works correctly end-to-end.
Documentation: To make the code more accessible and maintainable, I would add more documentation, including inline comments, a README file, and docstrings for the functions.
User interface: Currently, the code processes a single input file and outputs the results to a file. In a real-world scenario, we might want to provide a more user-friendly interface that allows users to specify input files, output formats, and other parameters. I would explore options for building a command-line interface or a graphical user interface to make the code more accessible.
By making these improvements, we could create a more robust, efficient, and user-friendly tool for grouping similar sentences and extracting changes.
